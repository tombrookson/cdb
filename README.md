# cdb
A simple database written in C.

Created by following https://cstack.github.io/db_tutorial/

## Building from source
To build the database from source, just run:
```
gcc cbd.c
```
Note: You done have to use GNU compiler, it's just what I'm using during development.

## Using the database
To start the shell, run:
```
./a.out
```

You will then enter the shell.
```
cdb> 
```

To `exit` the shell, just run:
```
cdb> .exit
```
